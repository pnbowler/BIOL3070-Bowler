## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots
```{r libraries}
# Libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

```
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
data <- read.csv("BEAM_data.csv")
#gene tp53 - underexpression(?)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


remotes::install_version("maptools", version = "1.1-8") # replace 1.2.3 with the desired version
